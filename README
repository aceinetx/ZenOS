ZenOS
=====
x64 uefi rust operating system centered around it's own language

! Designs below are not fully implemented, they are concepts and can change in the future !

Design of ZenOS
---------------
Bottom layer: Rust kernel
Middle layer: ZenLang Virtual Machine
Top layer: ZenLang

The lower the level, the more control over system you have.

This design allows for tunable executable priveleges. For example, you can make certain executables run at kernel, or at user level

Why are ZenLang VM and ZenLang seperate levels? The kernel controls the VM, kernel runs the executables, performs multithreading, ZenLang on the other hand does not do all of that. Joining these levels together would mean the kernel controls ZenLang itself, which is not what it does

Design of ZenLang
-----------------
ZenLang code is compiled to series of blocks, which we call "modules".
Modules can be dynamically loaded at any time of the program execution

Design of ZenLang Virtual Machine
---------------------------------
ZenLang VM is not a type of vm you would expect. It's not stack based, nor does it try to replicate how cpu's work
Instead, ZenLang VM is built on blocks and modules. Every block and module has an ID.
ZenLang VM executes blocks step by step, this means ZenLang VM has a program counter. In our case, it has not only one PC, but two - one for the block, one for the module
